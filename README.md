# Gui900 visual editor

**THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE AND MANY IMPORTANT PARTS ARE MISSING**

Gui900 visual editor is a web based app which helps you create an app based on [Gui900](https://github.com/Mammad900/Gui900) easily.

## How to use

- You can open the app by opening [this page](https://mammad900.github.io/Gui900-visual-editor/Gui900%20visual%20editor.html) (Not recommended)
- For more stability during load, you can download or clone this repository, and open the HTML file locally. But it does not support cookies.
